# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to create a map that will allow us to choose between 3 different map styles as well as show three different categories of geological information. These include:
1. all earthquakes that happened in the last 7 days
2. the tectonic plates
3. all major earthquakes in the last 7 days

Also, all the earthquakes will include a popup that shows their location and their magnitude.
